# Dreaming App

Dreaming App is a web application where users can share, view, and save their dreams. The goal is to create a creative and visually attractive space to record dreams, get inspired, and explore the dream experiences of other users.

> **Note:** This app is under construction and currently at Delivery 1 (Entrega 1).

## Concept

The app is designed as a collaborative and visual dream diary. Each user can create their "Dreamer" profile, add dreams, and view a generated dream gallery. The design uses dark colors and animated backgrounds to convey a nocturnal and creative atmosphere, with a modern and minimalist interface.

## Main Features

- **Dreams:** Add and save dreams associated with each dreamer.
- **Dreams Gallery:** View dreams in an attractive gallery.
- **Animations:** Animated background for an immersive experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Interface adaptable to any device.
- **Easy Navigation:** Navigation bar and footer present on all pages.

## Technologies & Dependencies

- **React** (with Vite)
- **Material UI** (MUI) for UI components
- **@tsparticles** for animated backgrounds
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **Pollinations AI Image API** for generating dream images with artificial intelligence
